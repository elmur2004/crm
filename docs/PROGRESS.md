# Progress log — append-only session journal

Read the latest entry at every session start; append one at every session end
(`/session-start`, `/session-end`). Format: `project-logging` skill.

## Entry 000 — 2026-08-08
- Done: Project starter scaffolded — SPEC.md v1.1 (both official brand systems
  integrated), docs/ skeleton, branding tokens for ByteForce and B-Systems
  (`branding/*/tokens.css`), Claude Code config (settings, 4 subagents, 10 skills incl.
  workflow slash commands), CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md, ADR-000/ADR-001 seeded.
- In progress: none — no application code exists yet.
- Next steps: `/session-start`, then Phase 0 per SPEC §14 (stack init, auth + roles,
  theming wired to both token files, pipeline-engine module + unit tests, seed
  scaffold), completing docs/ARCHITECTURE.md to v1.
- Blockers: none hard. Waiting on founder assets (see below) — Phase 0 can proceed with
  fallbacks.
- Needs founder confirmation: (1) logo files into `branding/byteforce/` and
  `branding/b-systems/` (READMEs list expected files); (2) Lama Sans font files into
  `branding/byteforce/fonts/` (A-13 fallback active until then); (3) SPEC §11 defaults
  A-1…A-13 stand unless overridden.
