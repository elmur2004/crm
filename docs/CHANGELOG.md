  Postgres for dev/tests, dev data carried over via the backup system.

## V2 — Unified role-aware B-Systems CRM (2026-08-09)
- Portal merged into the role-aware B-Systems CRM: negotiation stage,
  milestone-tab confirm-win, won leads/statements/payments, users +
  impersonation, agents/registrations sections, colored draggable board.
- Design system applied from the approved Claude Design prototype (ADR-031):
  new token sheet, dark B-Systems chrome, entity switcher, redesigned
  login/hub.
- Full admin backup/restore (ADR-032), animated UI motion layer, root now
  opens sign-in directly.

## Phase 5 — Hardening & handover (2026-08-09)
- Final demo seed: both brands populated across every stage, a converted partner
  with an attributed lead, and a won portal deal with a 3-milestone plan.
- Security proofs at the API level (rep/admin/staff walls); responsive + clean-
  console sweep at 1440/1024/768/390 across every screen; nav wraps on small
  viewports; B-Systems favicon (the S-mark).
- README with cold-start setup, demo accounts, test and deploy instructions.

## Phase 4 — Portal admin layer (2026-08-09)
- Admin dashboard (total leads, total estimated value, won deals, commissions).
- CRM with "All reps combined" / per-rep views; admin can move deals to Won.
- Won Deals management: estimated value + commission, milestone plans (any count),
  check/uncheck with sequential order; milestone sum warning (never blocking).
- Sales Team table: per-rep totals, per-stage counts, won value, commission.
- Reps see milestone unlocks live (≤5 s) without reloading.

- Landing page with the B-Systems signature gradient; sign-up with CV (instantly
  active, lands in the portal); phone login.
- Rep CRM: six-column Trello-style board — drag between stages opens the stage's
  form, cancel reverts; Won is admin-only (blocked with a clear message).
